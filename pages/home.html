      I'm a first-year ICT student with a background in a two-year vocational
      course in IT from TAFE SA. I love building things with code -- from small projects to hopefully big ones in the future! Lately, I've been
      spending most of my time working with <b>Python</b>, and I've built
      projects like a security manager app and a simple to-do list app using it
      (both console apps). In fact, I've dabbled in a bit of everything: <b>Java</b>,
      <b>SQL</b>, <b>C#</b> , <b>PHP</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>,
      even <b>Swift</b> -- all thanks to my vocational training. While I'm still
      exploring my niche, programming (in general) is definitely what interest me the most.

      Outside of coding, I'm a big on self-learning. I'm always on the lookout
      for certifications and new tech to play around with. I've recently dipped
      my toes into <b>React</b> and <b>Dart/Flutter</b>, and I enjoy figuring things out on my own, even when I get stuck -- it's all part of the process!
