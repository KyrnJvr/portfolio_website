  <p>I'm a first-year ICT student with a background in a two-year vocational course in IT from TAFE SA.  I love building things with code -- from small tools that make life easier to full-on applications. Lately, I've been spending most of my time working with <b>Python</b>, and I've built projects like a security manager app and a simple to-do list.
  
  I've dabbled in a bit of everything: <b>Java</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>C#</b> , <b>PHP</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>, even <b>Swift</b> -- thanks to my vocational training. While I'm still exploring my niche, programming (whether web or software) is definitely where I feel most at home.
  
  Outside of coding, I'm a big on self-learning. I'm always on the lookout for certifications and new tech to play around with. I've recently dipped my toes into React and Dart/Flutter, and I enjoy figuring things out on my own, even when I get stuck -- it's all part of the fun!
  
  Right now, I'm looking for internships or part-time opportunities to grow my skills and get hands-on experience. If you're working on something cool or just want to connect, feel free to reach out!</p>
